SIGNAL
signal i s two times in a row with a "low" pause of 8192us between them

The message buffer is 9 bytes long

Each signal starts with a preampble, the data and a postamble

PREAMBLE
consists of two "one"-bytes

DATA
9 bytes

POSTAMBLE
consists of one "zero"-byte

A "one" bit is sent over the air as:
high for 512us
low for 1024us
high for 512us

A "zero" bit is sent over the air as:
low for 512us
high for 1024us
low for 512us

1 byte = 8*(512+512+1024)us = 16384us
one signal = 2+9+1 bytes = 12 bytes = 196608us
signal + 8192 + signal = 401408us = 401.408ms
