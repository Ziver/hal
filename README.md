This project is a collection of utility classes and methods that I use in most of my projects.
Some of the code is incomplete and might never be completed (If no one is requesting otherwise :D).

**A word of warning:** This project is mostly used as a sandbox to implement APIs and functions I think are interesting. So there are no guaranties that Classes and methods will stay as they are, I'm often refactoring the code and moving things around.


## Running the tests

Execute all JUnit test-cases by running: 
```
